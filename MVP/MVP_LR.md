# MVP - Movie Revenue prediction using Linear Regression

## Linear Regression and Web Scraping


### Purpose:

Build linear regression model to predict the movie revenue using the [boxofficemojo movie dataset](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/) and understand the driving parameters


### Target Clients:
Movie producers, directors, investors would be heavily benefitted by this revenue prediction model


### Data Description:
Using web scraping to get the movie dataset from public websites:

â€¢	[boxofficemojo dataset](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)

Picked (domestic) movies by MPAA Ratings - G, G/PG, PG, PG-13, R

Target (Y): Domestic_total_revenue

Features (X):
1. Budget
2. Release Year
3. Rank_overall
4. Rank_by_mpaa_rating
5. Runtime
6. Rating

I have done the initial data cleaning and exploratory analysis on this movie dataset

### Modelling:

I. Plotted a pairplot to understand the relationship of the target (Y) with different features (X), and also relationship amongst the features themselves.

II. Divided the entire movie dataset into:
    1. Training set (80%)
    2. Holdout set i.e. Test dataset (20%)
    

### Findings:

1. Budget of the movie is almost linearly related to the movie revenue

Here are some of the helpful plots

All the following modelling in done on the Training dataset

1. Built a Linear Regression model

The model shows that movie budget is related to the movie box office total domestic revenue.
